# bioinformatics-problem-solving

This depository contains solutions to bioinformatic related problem from the platform Rosalind. Rosalind has hundreds and hundreds of problems and they are all so interesting so over the next while I will be aiming to complete as many as I can and looking to do atleast one problem per day. Let's see how it goes!

In this depository will be my solutions to a range of problems that Rosalind has in relation to bioinformatics. I will be using computation to transcribe DNA to RNA, infering mRNA to protein, base pair matching in relation to RNA folding strucutre, determining independant segregation of chromosomes, maximizing the gap symbols of an optimal alignment and many many more.

Feel free to provide any feedback or new challenges that I could explore in the field of genomics and proteomics in bioinformatics!
